# EDA-case-study-fue-economy
In this case study, I'll be analyzing fuel economy data provided by the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency. 

The fuel economy of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle. Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed. 

**I'll go through the entire data analysis process from the very first data gathering step to drawing conclusions and creating visuals to communicate results in the Jupyter notebook!**

I'am going to address and focus on the following questions: 
-
Q1: Are more unique models using alternative sources of fuel? By how much? 

Q2: How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy?
